## Architecture
In the beginning, I used docker containers and put these together with docker-compose. 
This docker-compose was running on a digital-ocean droplet with a load balancer in front to 
have an HTTPS cert and connection.

To have a better workflow for further development I switched to the digitial-ocean app platform.
The backend and frontend will be automatically rebuilt on every git merge on the main branch.
